## Introduction
The goal of this project is to analyze crime data by loading it into a SQLite database and performing various SQL queries and Python-based analyses. The data is visualized to provide insights into crime patterns, distributions, and trends over time.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- SQLite
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sqlalchemy`
